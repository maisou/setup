Everytime you launch the cheat it will load Cassidy mode (Triggerbot) by default then you can switch to other mode using (F2 F3 ... F12 etc.)

To update character settings. Open 'profiles.ini' using notepad edit the value then save file (Ctrl + S) and 
press [F10] to force cheat to reload config without restart program 

If you want to change the hotkey code see this > https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes 

Only Widow/Cassidy/Ashe/Sojourn has Triggerbot and Flickbot  (for sojourn is railgun beam)

While using Triggerbot you can press F12 to turn on/off Flickmode

Aimbot has 4 Profiles you can setting up them for Tracer/76/Dva/Zarya etc.

Precise Mode is for Flickbot only it will specific move mouse at exact X and Y position (For Head/Body etc) 
since this is external colorbot there is no way to get exact Head offset from the game 
and this is very close to that if you want to try to only shoot the head.

Flickbot without Precise mode will use same hitbox as Triggerbot more consistant shots but will try to shoot any part of the body

[INSERT] to enable ESP/Wallhack sometimes it bugged showing boxes on your teammates press [PageUp] on your keyboard to fix this

[HOME] Hide UI is for characters that require high precision. so the bot doesn't try to shoot at the enemy's health bar/name.
When this mode is enabled, while holding down the hotkey (aimbot/flickbot/triggerbot) it will toggle off in-game UI to get clear view of enemy 

Need to change In-Game Hotkey for Toggle UI to Mouse Wheel Scroll "UP" first 
Game Options Controls -> Interface -> Toggle UI -> Mouse Wheel Scroll UP

```
