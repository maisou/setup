Everytime you launch the cheat it will load Cassidy mode (Flickbot) by default then you can switch to other mode using (F2 F3 ... F12 etc.)

To update character settings. Open 'profiles.ini' using notepad edit the value then save file (Ctrl + S) then you can press [F10] to force cheat to reload config without restart program 

If you want to change the hotkey code see this > https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes 

Ex. 0x01 = Left Click
    0x02 = Right Click
    0x05 = Mouse 4 (side button)
    0x06 = Mouse 5 (side button)
    0xA4 = Left Alt

Only Widow/Cassidy/Ashe/Sojourn has Triggerbot and Flickbot  (for sojourn is railgun shot)

While using Flickmode you can press F12 to switch to Triggerbot

Aimbot has 4 Profiles you can setting up them for Tracer/76/Dva/Zarya/Bastion etc.

Precise Mode is for Flickbot it will specific move mouse at exact position on the enemy using aim height (For Head/Body etc) 

Flickbot without Precise mode will use same hitbox as Triggerbot more consistant shots but will try to shoot any part of the body

[INSERT] to enable ESP/Wallhack  if it showing boxes on your teammate press [PageUp] on your keyboard to fix this

[HOME] Hide UI is for characters that require high precision like Widow or Sojourn. so the bot doesn't try to shoot at the enemy's health bar/name.
(its optional and sometime unnecessary to enable this)
When this mode is enabled, while holding down the hotkey (aimbot/flickbot/triggerbot) it will toggle off in-game UI to get clear view of enemy 

you need to change In-Game Hotkey for Toggle UI to Mouse Wheel Scroll "UP" first
